## Folder Structure

```
|-- additionals (contains all the additional experiments that we conducted)
|-- weakly_supervised_segmentation_baseline (the baseline model we conducted all our experiments on)
|-- weakly_supervised_segmentation_improved_model (improved model from our experiments)
|-- run_all_code.py (script to automate running the experiments)
|-- instruction.pdf (PDF version of the instructions)
```

## Running the Experiments

### Please execute the `run_all_code.py` file using the following command:

```bash
python3 run_all_code.py
```

This will automate the process of installing the libraries required to run the experiment, as well as running our baseline and improved models.
